# C++XGBoost
This is my first C++ app. This is my attempt implementing XGBoost in C++. So far I have done linear regression XGBoost, and can save/load the model. The repo is built entirely on naive C++ for MacOS. So if you want to try this on Linux or Windows, some modifications might be required. 
# Future tasks
I will keep updating this repo for classification capability and missing values handling as in original model. I'll try to implement histogram-based splitting, as well as implementing parallel computation with Metal, MacBook GPUs.
